# 🗺️ Leaflet Zone Selector - Master Project Tracker

**Labels**: epic, project-management, documentation

## Project Overview

Leaflet Zone Selector is a React/TypeScript library for interactive geographic zone selection using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap. This master issue tracks all development tasks organized by phase.

## Architecture Summary

- **Map Engine**: Leaflet + React-Leaflet
- **Tiles**: OpenStreetMap (no API key required)
- **Geocoding**: Nominatim (OSM's free geocoding service)
- **Geo Operations**: Turf.js
- **Build**: Vite
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Package Format**: ESM + UMD

## 📋 Development Phases & Issues

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅

- [ ] #13: Create Export Functionality (GeoJSON, KML, CSV)
- [ ] #14: Build Theme System with CSS Variables
- [ ] #15: Add Loading States and Error Boundaries
- [ ] #16: Implement Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] #17: Create City Boundaries Data Structure
- [ ] #18: Build District Mappings for Major Cities

### Phase 6: Testing & Quality 🚧
- [ ] #19: Write Comprehensive Unit Tests
- [ ] #20: Create Integration Test Suite
- [ ] #21: Performance Testing & Optimization
- [ ] #22: Accessibility Testing & Improvements

### Phase 7: Documentation & Examples 🚧
- [ ] #23: Create Comprehensive README
- [ ] #24: Build Basic Usage Example
- [ ] #25: Create Delivery Zone Management Demo
- [ ] #26: Generate TypeDoc API Documentation

### Phase 8: Production & Distribution 🚧
- [ ] #27: Configure NPM Publishing Workflow
- [ ] #28: Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [ ] #29: Create Migration Guide from Mapbox
- [ ] #30: Prepare v1.0.0 Release

## 🎯 Key Milestones

1. **MVP (Minimal Viable Product)**
   - Basic map with zone rendering
   - Click to select/deselect zones
   - Adjacent zone merging
   - Export selected zones

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Search functionality
   - Drawing tools
   - Metrics calculation
   - Theme customization

3. **Production Ready**
   - Full test coverage
   - Documentation complete
   - Examples provided
   - NPM package published

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Completed ✅
- Core infrastructure setup
- Main component architecture
- Type system definition
- Zone rendering and selection
- Search functionality design

### In Progress 🚧
- Additional feature specifications
- Testing infrastructure
- Documentation

### Not Started ❌
- Implementation
- Example applications
- Publishing setup

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

1. **Leaflet over Mapbox**: Free, no API key required, open source
2. **Nominatim for Geocoding**: Free OSM service, no limits for reasonable usage
3. **Turf.js for Geo Operations**: Industry standard, well-tested
4. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Better type safety and developer experience
5. **Hooks-based Architecture**: Modern React patterns, better composability
